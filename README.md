## Rationale

The [**SPOTLIGHT**][spotlight] project is a multibeam, commensal survey for FRBs and pulsars soon to be undertaken at the [**GMRT**][gmrt]. It is estimated that it will produce almost 1 PB worth of data per day[^1]. Therefore, it is obviously impossible for a mere human being, or even a group of them, to sift through and classify all the millions and billions of resulting FRB candidates. Thus, we plan to use [**`FETCH`**][fetch], a ML/DL-based classifier. However, every classifier requires some features per candidate, for both training and classification. `FETCH` requires two features to classify candidates: their **dedispersed dynamic spectrum**, and their **DM transform** (**DMT**). The authors of `FETCH` recommend using utility scripts packaged with their associated library, [**`your`**][your], to generate them: `your_candmaker.py` and `your_h5plotter.py`. However, these scripts were developed and tested using data taken from high-frequency telescopes, such as the VLA. Thus, for low-frequency data obtained via the GMRT, the features generated by these scripts proved to be sub-optimal (see the plot below). The scripts were also much slower than real time despite using the GPU.

<br/>

**Fig:** Variation of the **DM transform** (**DMT**) over different frequency bands at the GMRT. From left to right, we are going from lower to higher frequency. For real signals, we expect a bow-tie pattern in the DMT, which becomes more and more difficult to observe at lower frequencies. Plots in the first row were created using [**`your`**][your]'s `your_candmaker.py`, while plots in the second row were created via [**`candies`**][candies] for the same exact bursts.

<br/>

Thus, we decided to develop [**`candies`**][candies], our feature extraction library for FRB candidates. Primarily developed by [**me**][me] as a part of my (ongoing) PhD (and with the help of engineers from [**NVIDIA**][nvidia]), it hopes to be a better and faster variant of [**`your`**][your]'s scripts used for the same thing.

## Features

[**`candies`**][candies] plans to introduce the following features:

- [x] Zooming into the DMT (*see plots above*).
- [ ] Dealing with band-limited bursts.
- [ ] Support for GMRT's shared memory based ring buffers.

Currently, we only support processing data stored in the SIGPROC filterbank format, but support for additional formats might be added if there is any interest from the community at large.

## Installation

[**`candies`**][candies] is on PyPI, and hence can be installed by simply running:
```bash
pip install candies
```
In case you are interested in the cutting edge, you can also git clone and install it directly via Github:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/astrogewgaw/candies
cd candies
pip install -e .
```
where the `-e` flag is for an *editable install*; that is, any changes to the source code will reflect directly in your installation. If you don't want that, just remove the flag, or you can go ahead and use the more direct method:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/astrogewgaw/candies
```

> **Note**: To get plotting working in [**`candies`**][candies], you will have to install [**`proplot`**][proplot]. It is recommended that you do not do so via PyPI (that is, do not do `pip install proplot`). Instead, use the following command to install [**`proplot`**][proplot]:
>
>```bash
>pip install git+https://github.com/proplot-dev/proplot.git@refs/pull/459/head
>```
> This is due to several issues with the `main` branch of [**`proplot`**][proplot] (see [\#461](https://github.com/proplot-dev/proplot/issues/461), [\#451](https://github.com/proplot-dev/proplot/issues/454), [\#453](https://github.com/proplot-dev/proplot/issues/453), [\#451](https://github.com/proplot-dev/proplot/issues/451), [\#432](https://github.com/proplot-dev/proplot/issues/432), [\#418](https://github.com/proplot-dev/proplot/issues/418), and [\#309](https://github.com/proplot-dev/proplot/issues/309)), which is incompatible with the latest versions of `matplotlib` and other packages. Installing from the as-of-yet-unmerged pull request above solves this issue. In case [**`proplot`**][proplot] is not installed, plotting will fail, and raise an error.

## Quick Guide

For help with how to use [**`candies`**][candies], just type and run `candies` or `candies --help`. To process a list of FRB candidates stored as a CSV file, just use the command:

```bash
candies make /path/to/candidate/list
```

To see what additional options you can use, just type `candies make --help`. To plot one or several HDF5 files generated as output, just run:

```bash
candies plot /path/to/HDF5/files
```

Once more, type `candies plot --help` to see what options are available to you. Note that the plotting command will only work if you have [**`proplot`**][proplot] installed; see the note above regarding the same. You can also generate a list of candidates on the terminal, via:

```bash
candies list /path/to/HDF5/files
```

This command is useful is you just have a bunch of HDF5 files generated via [**`candies`**][candies], and you want to have a quick look at their details. You can also save these details as a CSV file, for later use.
